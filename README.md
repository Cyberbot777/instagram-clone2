# Instagram Clone 2


**A simplified Instagram post clone built for 4Geeks Academy bootcamp.**

## Overview
This project is my first assignment for the 4Geeks Academy coding bootcamp and my second Instagram clone (following a pre-work course project). It recreates a single Instagram post, featuring:

- A header with profile picture and username
- A main image
- A footer with like, comment, share icons, and a caption

It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, styled with Bootstrap, Font Awesome icons, and Roboto font from Google Fonts. Images are sourced from Pexels.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using Bootstrap.
- **Interactive Like Button**: Toggles heart icon and color on click.
- **Modern Styling**: Employs Roboto font for an Instagram-like aesthetic.
- **High-Quality Images**: Free, royalty-free images from Pexels.
