Instagram Clone 2
Overview
This is my first project for the 4Geeks Academy coding bootcamp, a simplified Instagram post clone (my second Instagram clone, including a pre-work course project). It replicates a single Instagram post with a header (profile picture and username), an image, and a footer (like, comment, share icons, and caption). Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses Bootstrap for layout, Font Awesome for icons, and Roboto font from Google Fonts. Images are sourced from Pexels.
